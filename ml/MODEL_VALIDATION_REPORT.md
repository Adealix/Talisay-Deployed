## 🎯 Seed/Fruit-to-Oil Ratio Analysis

### What Your Model Reports:

For a typical **GREEN** Talisay fruit:
```
📏 Physical Characteristics:
   - Length: 5.0 cm
   - Width: 4.6 cm
   - Kernel Mass: 0.494 g
   - Whole Fruit Weight: 37.6 g
   
🧮 Ratios Calculated:
   - Kernel to Fruit Ratio: 1.3% (0.494g / 37.6g)
   - Oil Yield from Kernel: 47.6%
   - Oil Yield from Whole Fruit: 0.62% (47.6% × 1.3%)
   
🛢️ Absolute Oil Content:
   - Oil per Fruit: ~0.235g (0.62% of 37.6g)
   - Oil per kg of Fruit: ~6.2g
```

### Scientific Validation:
This aligns with literature indicating:
- Kernel typically represents 1-3% of whole fruit weight
- Oil is extracted from the kernel only
- Green fruits have lower kernel development
- Mature yellow fruits would yield significantly more oil
